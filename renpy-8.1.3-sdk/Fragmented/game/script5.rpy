    "You and the Duchess cautiously step through the creaking doorway, your senses alert to any movement."

    duchess "Be on your guard. We don't know what lies within."

    "As you move deeper into the mill, the floorboards suddenly give way above you with a deafening crack."



    "You're thrown to the ground as the ceiling collapses, sending up a cloud of dust and splinters as the wood crashes down. The Duchess is knocked back, struggling to regain her footing."

    "From the gaping hole in the floor, a monstrous form emerges. It's a grotesque amalgamation of flesh and darkness, its body twisted and malformed. Its skin is a sickly green, covered in pulsating boils and oozing sores."

    "The creature's eyes are like voids, black and endless, fixated on you with a malevolent hunger. Its mouth, a jagged maw of razor-sharp teeth, opens to emit a guttural, chilling hiss."

    monster "YOUUUUuuu..."

    "The air grows cold, the very atmosphere tainted by the creature's malevolent presence. You feel a primal fear clawing at your heart, but you steel yourself, gripping your weapon tightly."

    "The Duchess, recovering from the initial shock, stands beside you, her expression one of grim determination."

    duchess "We must end this abomination."

    "The creature lunges forward, its movements a blur of malice and fury."

    "The creature lies defeated at your feet, its twisted form slowly dissolving into shadow and mist. The air feels lighter as if a great weight has been lifted."

    "You and the Duchess stand in the aftermath, catching your breath, the adrenaline of the fight still coursing through your veins."

    duchess "You fought bravely. This creature... it was a blight upon our land."

    mc "It's over now. The mill... and your people... are safe."

    "The Duchess looks around the old mill, her gaze lingering on the remnants of the creature."

    duchess "Safe? Ha. This victory... it's a step towards reclaiming our home. But there's still much to be done."

    mc "We'll face whatever comes. Together."

    "The Duchess nods. Together, you exit the mill, leaving the shadows of the ruined mill behind."
